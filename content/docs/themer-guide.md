**Note:** Reading the [Documentation](https://github.com/Aliucord/documentation/blob/main/theme-dev) and using the [Theme maker site](https://aliucord.com/theme-maker) can help you make your own theme.

**If the theme you are using doesn't work for you, either you are not using the right transparency mode, you are not using theme mirror from `#theme-support` pins (this only affects image background), or Themer is broken on your end (can happen depending on Android version/OS)**

## How to set a custom background

First of all, you need to enable transparency in Themer settings (chat, chat & settings). If you want full transparency, you need to use the template found below.

**ALLOWED HOSTS:** GitHub, GitLab, Imgbb, Imgur, Locally (this one is not a website but your local files).

**GitHub:**
  - Create a GitHub account
  - Create a repo (make sure it's public)
  - Click `Add file` and upload the image/gif
  - Once uploaded, click its name
  - Hold the image and copy the address
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Background` & paste it

**Locally:**
  - Install [this file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
  - Find the image/gif file
  - Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy path`
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Background` & paste it
  - Add `file://` at the start
  - Final result should be `file:///storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.jpg`

## How to set a custom font

First of all, you need to enable the `Enable Custom Fonts` option in Themer settings.

**GitHub:**
  - Create a GitHub account
  - Create a repo (make sure it's public)
  - Click `Add file` and upload the font
  - Once uploaded, click its name
  - Hold `View raw` and copy the address
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Fonts` & paste it where the asterisk is

**Note:** If the font you want is already uploaded in some repo, you can just copy the raw link, no need to make your own repo.

**Locally:**
  - Install [this file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
  - Find the font file
  - Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy path`
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Fonts` & paste it where the asterisk is
  - Add `file://` at the start
  - Final result should be `file:///storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.ttf`

## Why does my background image not work

- You didn't enable transparency
- You enabled full transparency which doesn't work without the template
- You are using `cdn.discordapp.com` or `media.discordapp.net` which don't work as a valid URL anymore
- The URL is incorrect

## How to make the background work with full transparency

- Open the [template](https://github.com/OasisVee/theme-templates/blob/main/full-transparency-background-template.json)
- Press the 3 dots and download
- Move the downloaded `.json` to your `Aliucord/themes` folder using a file manager & restart Aliucord if it was open
- Go to Themer settings, enable full transparency & enable the theme
- Go inside the theme settings → `Background` & paste the image/gif url
- Press back, press the save button & restart Aliucord
